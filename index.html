            Chirag/West Chirag Reservoir Management Team. Provided technical support for the short and long term management of the reservoir taking into account
             Reservoir Design Operating Limits and future wells drillability. Actively participated in sector review/surveillance sessions and full filled reservoir 
             engineering responsibilities.  
            •	Delivered 2 well targets in Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field with overall value of 8 MMstb
            •	Provided Reservoir Engineering support to the optimization of 7 drilling targets
            •	History matched reservoir model, which lead to correct reserve estimation for SEC submission
            •	Estimated radius of the cross-flowed water using mechanistic numerical model, resulted targeting a well in a safe distance from risked zone, hence saving 1 MMstb reserves (50 million dollars benefit to company)	</td>

            Azeri Base Management Team. Worked as a platform support engineer. Supported Operations team from subsurface perspective. Provided support to RMT by regularly and actively participating in well review sessions and supporting well planning process. Provided sand management support on high rate wells by performing acoustic and bottom-hole pressure analysis. Planned and implemented Pressure Transient Analysis (PIE software) and used results to help optimize drilling strategy
            •	Through continuous monitoring and surveillance of well parameters prevented a sand fill on high rate producer (12 mstb/d)
            •	Achieved 95% accuracy in well rate allocation underpinned by precise well testing results, performed in a short timeframe, so decreasing deferrals due to testing in high pressure bulk
            •	Provided crucial guidelines to offshore operations team on new well start up procedures
